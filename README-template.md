## Overview

This is a solution to the [Huddle landing page with single introductory section challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/huddle-landing-page-with-a-single-introductory-section-B_2Wvxgi0). It aims to create a visually appealing and visually as close as possible to the original order summary component.

### The challenge

This is a solution for the "Huddle landing page with single introductory section" challenge from Frontend Mentor.

The challenge was to create a landing page with the following features:

- Display a header with a logo.
- Show an introductory section with an image, heading, paragraph, and a registration button.
- Design a footer with social media icons.

I used HTML and CSS to build the landing page. Here's an overview of the code structure:

- The HTML file (`index.html`) includes the necessary HTML elements for the header, main content, and footer sections.
- The CSS file (`style.css`) contains the styles to customize the appearance of the page, including backgrounds, fonts, alignments, and responsiveness.
